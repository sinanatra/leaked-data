Interim Health Guidance from the Federal Aviation Administration and 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for 
Air Carriers and Crews
February 2, 2020
Purpose 
The United States has confirmed cases of individuals who have a contagious, 
respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) coronavirus (“2019-nCoV”) first detected 
in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.  This virus has rapidly spread across China and 
Chinese health officials have reported thousands of infections with 2019-nCoV in 
China, with evidence of the virus spreading from person-to-person in many parts of 
that country.  
The Director General of the World Health Organization has declared that the outbreak 
of 2019-nCoV constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The 
Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has declared that 
2019-nCoV constitutes a public health emergency. The Centers for Disease Control 
(CDC) is closely watching for spread in the United States and is actively monitoring 
hundreds of individuals with contacts related to Wuhan City. 
  
The CDC and FAA are providing the following health guidance for: U.S.-based flight 
and cabin crewmembers while in China; U.S.- and third country-based flight and cabin 
crewmembers upon arriving to the United States within 14 days of travel to, from, or 
within China; China-based flight and cabin crewmembers while in the U.S.; U.S. air 
carriers housing flight and cabin crews while in China; and U.S. air carriers supervising 
self-monitoring of flight and cabin crews who have had layovers in China. 
Guidance for U.S.-based flight and cabin crews while in China: 
•
Travel as a group in private transport provided by the air carrier when traveling 
between the airport and hotel.  
o
Minimize contact with ground personnel and time in public areas while 
moving between the aircraft and the private transport.  
o
Do not use public transportation, including when traveling between the 
airport and hotel.  
•
Minimize going out into the general population, and use social distancing 
(maintain a distance of approximately 6 feet, if possible) whenever out in 
public. Avoid crowds, stores, sporting or mass entertainment events, and other 
situations likely to attract large numbers of people.

TESTING FOR DRUGS AND ALCOHOL
The  City  will  conduct  drug  and  alcohol  testing  of  applicants  and  its  employees  (including
mechanics and management drivers) in compliance with regulations established by the DOT, 49
CFR Part 40 and the FMCSA, 49 CFR Part 382.
A.
COVERED EMPLOYEES
In accord with FMCSA Regulations, employees subject to drug and alcohol testing are those
employees of the City who are required to hold a CDL and who operate a CMV, when that vehicle:
(1) has a gross combination weight rating of 26,001 or more pounds inclusive of a towed unit with
a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds; (2) has a gross vehicle weight rating of
26,001 or more pounds; (3) is designed to transport 16 or more persons including a driver; or (4) is
a vehicle of any size that transports materials found to be hazardous for the purposes of the
Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. 5103(b)) and which requires the motor vehicle
to be placarded under the Hazardous Materials Regulations (40 CFR Part 172, Subpart F).
B. 
FMCSA PROHIBITED CONDUCT:
An employee shall not:
1. Report for duty or remain on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions
while having an alcohol concentration of 0.04% or greater.
2. Use alcohol, including medications containing alcohol, while performing safety-sensitive
functions.
3. Perform safety-sensitive functions within four (4) hours after using alcohol, including the
use of medications that contain alcohol.
4. Use alcohol for eight (8) hours following an accident, or until the employee has undergone a
post-accident test, whichever occurs first.
5. Refuse to submit to a pre-employment, post-accident, random, reasonable suspicion,
 
or
follow-up alcohol and/or drug test.
6. Report for duty or remain on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions
when he/she uses any controlled  substances,  except when the use is  pursuant to the
instructions of a licensed medical practitioner who has advised the employee that the
substance does not adversely affect the employee’s ability to operate a CMV safely.
7. Report for duty, remain on duty, or perform safety-sensitive functions if he/she tests
positive for controlled substances.
If an employee engages in any of the conduct prohibited in Section B above, the employee is not
qualified, under FMCSA regulations, to drive a CMV. He/she shall be immediately removed from
all safety-sensitive functions including driving and will be terminated from employment.
Under FMCSA regulations, an employee who is found to have an alcohol concentration of 0.02%
or greater, but less than 0.04%, may not operate or continue to operate a CMV or provide other
safety sensitive functions for a twenty-four (24) hour period.

SCOPE
The City’s Drug and Alcohol Policy for DOT-covered employees applies to all full-time, part-time,
and  temporary  employees  (including  “seasonal  drivers”)  who  are  “covered  drivers”  or
“crewmembers” as defined in Section VII (A). In addition, this policy covers all applicants for
positions that require CDLs for the operating of CMVs, as described in Section VII (A). In
circumstances not addressed by DOT regulations or in this policy, DOT-covered employees are
also subject to the City’s Drug and Alcohol Policy for all employees, which should be read in
conjunction with this policy.
III.
DEFINITIONS
* Accident means an occurrence involving a CMV operating on a public road, in which:
1. There is the loss of human life; or
2. The driver receives a citation under state or local law for a moving traffic  violation  arising
from the accident; and
a.
Any involved vehicle sustains disabling damage as defined in this policy; and/or
b. Anyone receives bodily injury that requires immediate medical treatment away from
the accident scene.
*Adulterated specimen means a specimen that contains a substance that is not expected to be
present in human urine or contains a substance expected to be present but is at a concentration so
high that it is not consistent with human urine.
*Alcohol means the intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or other low molecular
weight alcohols including methyl and isopropyl alcohol.
*Alcohol concentration (or content) means the alcohol in a volume of breath expressed in terms of
grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath as indicated by an evidential breath test (BrAC).
*Alcohol screening test means an analytic procedure to determine whether an employee may have a
prohibited concentration of alcohol in a breath specimen.
*Alcohol use means the drinking or swallowing of any beverage, liquid mixture or preparation
(including any medication), containing alcohol.
*Breath Alcohol Technician (“BAT”) is an individual who is certified to operate an Evidential
Breath Testing (“EBT”) device and who is proficient in breath-testing procedures.
*Canceled test means a drug or alcohol test that has a problem identified that cannot be or has not
been corrected or which is otherwise required by 49 CFR Part 40 to be canceled. A canceled test is
neither a positive nor a negative test. The City will not take adverse job action based on a canceled
test.

able to be conducted, the tests conducted by law enforcement may meet the requirement of
this Section, provided those tests conform to applicable federal, state, or local requirements.
The City will request test results and other pertinent documentation from such agencies or
law enforcement authorities, and will require the employee to sign a release allowing the
City to obtain such information.  Refusal to sign such a release will be grounds for
termination of employment.
In the event that an employee is so seriously injured that the employee cannot provide a
sample of urine or breath at the time of the accident, the City requires that the employee
provide necessary authorization for the City to obtain hospital records or other documents
that would indicate whether drugs or alcohol were present (and the resulting levels) in the
employee’s body at the time of the accident. Refusal to sign such a release will be grounds
for termination of employment.
3. Random Testing
A percentage of employees will be subject to random alcohol and drug testing each year.
The percentage of employees to be tested will be as determined annually by FMCSA and
published in the Federal Register every January. Selections of employees to be tested shall
be done by a scientifically valid method that provides that each employee will have an equal
chance of being selected each time that selections are made.  Thus, an employee might be
selected more than once during a year.
a. 
Random tests will be unannounced, and the dates for random tests will be spread
throughout the year.
b. 
An employee who is selected for random testing will be required to report to the
collection site immediately upon notification. If the employee engages in conduct
that does not lead to a collection as soon as possible after notification, such conduct
may be considered as a refusal to submit to a test. The employee will be in a paid
duty status from the time he/she leaves to go to the collection site until the time
he/she returns from the collection site.
c. 
A random test for alcohol shall be scheduled to occur only just prior to, during, or
just after performing a safety-sensitive function, or at any time that the employee is
in readiness to provide safety-sensitive function.
d. 
A random test for drugs can be scheduled at any time the employee is on duty and is
not related to when the employee is performing safety-sensitive function.
e. 
An employee who has been selected for random testing must be tested in that testing
period. FMCSA regulations do not permit a replacement to be named if the selected
employee is unavailable for testing.

 Section 10-50 of the Cannabis Act:
 Nothing in this Act shall be construed to interfere with any federal, State, or local
restrictions on employment including, but not limited to, the United States Department of
Transportation regulation 49 CFR 40.151(e) or impact an employer’s ability to comply with
federal or State law or cause it to lose a federal or State contract or funding.
 49 CFR 40.151(e): Medical Review Officers are prohibited from “verify[ing] a test negative
based on information that a physician recommended that the employee use a drug listed in
Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. (e.g., under a state law that purports to
authorize such recommendations, such as the “medical marijuana” laws that some states
have adopted).
 TAKEAWAY: Employee who cannot pass a federally mandatory testing (e.g. DOT) is unlikely
to be protected by the ADA or otherwise because passing such testing is an essential job
requirement.

By Peter J. Gillespie

Employers concerned by these find-

recent loosening of restrictions on 
marijuana use at the state level. More-
over, despite the fact that marijuana 
remains illegal under federal law, 
the Occupational Safety and Health

use. Specifically, based on findings

Alert your manager or department’s HR Liaison to how you are feeling. Upon departing from work,
contact your healthcare provider via telephone for further direction.
As an employee, if I am feeling anxious or troubled by the uncertainty that exists, where do I get 
assistance?
Please contact our Employee Assistance Program.
City of Chicago Employee Assistance Program
Phone: 1-312-744-9711; TTY: 1-877-744-5035
Will COVID-19 tests be more available and accessible to staff? When would a test be advised? 
At this time, there is not a way to provide testing for all City employees. If you have symptoms of
COVID-19, you should contact your medical provider. Tests are becoming more widely available in
Chicago, many at no cost, and the City’s health care plan pays for the entire cost of the testing;
there is no co-pay.  
What will be the protocol when a staff member tests positive for COVID? Will co-workers be 
notified? Will the location have to be closed for cleaning and sanitizing? 
Any time an employee who has been in the workpalce tests positive for COVID-19, the City will
provide a notification to employees who share the same worksite with that employee. Employees
who were identified as having had close contact with the employee who tested positive will receive
a separate notification and, in most instances, be told to quarantine for a period of time. 
AIS has implemented enhanced cleaning protocols for facilities and vehicles when an employee has
reported that they have tested positive for COVID-19. There may be variations in buildings not
managed and cleaned by AIS custodial staff and vendors. 
COMMUTING AND TRAVEL
What are the best practices to ensure a safe commute to work on public transportation? 

Socially distance whenever possible. 

Wear a cloth face covering.

Do not touch your face.

Clean hands after taking public transportation.

If you require an extension to your paperwork due date, you must contact me to relay the situation as soon as
possible. Approval for due date extensions is based upon the circumstances surrounding your inability to obtain
corrected and sufficient information within the allotted seven (7) calendar days. If you do not contact me to
request an extension of your due date, or if we are unable to grant you an extension to your due date, your leave
will be denied after the allotted seven (7) calendar days if no paperwork is received in that time.

longer than 10 days, then the compensation must be prorated accordingly.  No
amount  of  compensation,  however,  is  permitted  for  anticipated  profits  on
unperformed Services.  The City and Contractor must attempt to agree on the
amount of compensation to be paid to Contractor, but if not agreed on, the dispute
must be settled in accordance with Article 5 of this Agreement.  The payment so
made to Contractor is in full settlement for all Services satisfactorily performed
under this Agreement.

Contractor must include in its contracts with Subcontractors an early termination
provision in form and substance equivalent to this early termination provision to
prevent claims against the City arising from termination of subcontracts after the

suspension are  allowed.   Contractor  must  promptly  resume  its  performance  of the
Services under the same terms and conditions as stated in this Agreement upon written
notice by the CommissionerComptroller and such equitable extension of time as may be
mutually agreed upon by the CommissionerComptroller and Contractor when necessary
for continuation or completion of Services.  Any additional costs or expenses actually
incurred by Contractor as a result of recommencing the Services must be treated in
accordance with the compensation provisions under Article 4 of this Agreement.
No suspension of this Agreement is permitted in the aggregate to exceed a period of 45
days within any one year of this Agreement.  If the total number of days of suspension
exceeds 45 days, Contractor by written notice to the City may treat the suspension as an
early termination of this Agreement under Section 8.3.

Every waiver and/or reduction request must include evidence that the bidder has provided timely notice 
of the need for subcontractors to an appropriate association/assist agency representative of the 
MBE/WBE business community. This notice must be given at least five (5) business days in advance of the 
initial bid due date.
The notice requirement of this Section will be satisfied if a bidder contacts at least one of the associations 
on Attachment A to these Regulations when the prime contractor seeks a waiver or reduction in the 
utilization goals.  Attachment B to these Regulations provides the letter format that a prime contractor 
may use.  Proof of notification prior to bid submittal (e.g. certified mail receipt or facsimile transmittal 
receipt) will be required to be submitted with the bid for any bid/proposal to be deemed responsive.  If 
deemed appropriate, the Contract Compliance Officer may contact the assist agency for verification of 
notification.
iii.
Impracticability
If the Chief Procurement Officer determines that a lesser MBE and/or WBE percentage standard is 
appropriate with respect to a particular contract subject to competitive bidding prior to the bid 
solicitations for such contract, bid specifications shall include a statement of such revised standard.
The requirements set forth in these Regulations (this subsection e.  ""Regulations Governing Reductions to 
or Waiver of MBE/WBE Goals"") shall not apply where the Chief Procurement Officer determines prior to 
the bid solicitations that MBE/WBE subcontractor participation is impracticable.
This may occur whenever the Chief Procurement Officer determines that for reasons of time, need, 
industry practices or standards not previously known by the Chief Procurement Officer, or such other 
extreme circumstances as may be deemed appropriate, such a Waiver is in the best interests of the City.  
This determination may be made in connection with a particular contract, whether before the contract is 
let for bid, during the bid or award process, before or during negotiation of the contract, or during the 
performance of the contract.
For all notifications required to be made by bidders, in situations where the Chief Procurement Officer has
determined that time is of the essence, documented telephone contact may be substituted for letter 
contact.
f.
Procedure to Determine Bid Compliance 
A bid may be rejected as non-responsive if it fails to submit one or more of the following with its bid 
demonstrating its Good Faith Efforts to meet the Contract Specific Goals by reaching out to MBEs and WBEs to
perform work on the contract:

An MBE/WBE compliance plan demonstrating how the bidder plans to meet the Contract Specific 
Goals; and/or

A request for reduction or waiver of the Contract Specific Goals in accordance with Section 2-92-450 
of the MCC.  
In the case of a bid utilizing the ""Bid Incentive to Encourage MBE and WBE Utilization"" pursuant to MCC 2-92-
525(b)(2), failure to submit an MBE/WBE compliance plan demonstrating how the bidder plans to meet the 
Contract Specific Goal to which the bidder has committed will not result in rejection of the bid, but the bidder 
may be found ineligible for the bid incentive.
Except as provided in MCC 2-92-525(b)(2), only compliance plans utilizing MBE and WBE firms that meet BOTH
the Commercially Useful Function and Area of Specialty requirements will be counted toward the Contract 
Specific Goals.

The district’s goal is to begin distributing devices promptly, and families will receive specific 
information regarding device distribution in the coming days. The district is focusing 
distribution on computing devices, including laptops, ChromeBooks and iPads. While the 
district does not have the resources to provide Internet access for every student, Comcast 
and AT&T are currently offering free internet access for high-need families. 
  
To improve access to modern technology in schools throughout Chicago, in 2018 the district 
launched a multi-year strategy to ensure all schools have the devices and bandwidth for 
students to learn using state-of-the-art digital tools. Currently, 145 schools have one device 
for each student, and the average CPS school has one device per 1.4 students. According to a 
recent survey, a quarter of CPS schools have already sent home devices with at least some of 
their students.  
  
CITY COLLEGES OF CHICAGO 
 
On March 23, City Colleges of Chicago (CCC) implemented remote learning and shifted 
classes for its more than 30,000 credit-earning students online. The community college 
system went from 10 percent of credit class sections being taught fully online to 92 percent 
of credit class sections being taught fully online as of today. City Colleges also shifted its 
student services from previously being almost entirely in-person to exclusively online. City 
Colleges students can access admissions, advising, the library, tutoring, financial aid, 
registrar, business office, veterans services, transfer services, wellness center, information 
technology help desk, disability access centers, and our Call Center, all online 
at www.ccc.edu/vss. 
  
“I am so proud of the teamwork and flexibility shown by our students, faculty and staff who 
made the transition to remote learning in just one week’s time,” said Chancellor Juan 
Salgado. “We recognize our students, in particular, are facing unprecedented challenges, and 
we are committed to providing them every possible support to ensure they persist in their 
courses and reach their academic and career goals.” 
  
To facilitate the transition to remote learning, City Colleges offered faculty and staff 
trainings on Brightspace, its online learning management system and Zoom, its online 
meeting tool. Nearly 850 laptops have been shipped to students in need to date with at least 
another 627 shipping today, and loaner hotspots will also be available for students on a 
first-come, first-serve basis later this week. City Colleges is also transitioning its emergency 
fund online. The COVID-19 City Colleges Student Emergency Fund will begin the process of 
offering payments directly to students for emergency needs later this week. 
  
On April 13, City Colleges’ free adult education courses, including GED and English as a 
Second Language, will start to be offered via distance learning. City Colleges is also offering 
loaner laptops for adult education students, who can apply 
at https://apps.ccc.edu/LoanerLaptop/login.

their students. Learning plans will include daily digital and non-digital learning 
opportunities for all students, office hours for parents and students, and more. Through 
remote learning in CPS: 
  
• 
Schools will provide students with daily learning activities. 
o 
Schools will offer both digital and non-digital learning options to promote 
equitable access to instructional materials. 
o 
Schools can create their own activities or augment enrichment activities 
provided by the district, which will be created every two weeks during the 
closure. 
o 
Teachers will provide weekly feedback to students on the assigned learning 
activities they complete. 
• 
Teachers will be directly available to their students for academic support, which 
may include digital learning and follow-up with students who lack digital access. 
o 
Schools will have the flexibility to determine how best to provide learning 
opportunities, and teachers will be expected to be available for four hours 
per school day. Potential activities include: 
▪ 
Streaming live activities, including a mini-lesson, book reading, 
digital discussion or lecture, with a maximum of two hours of digital 
learning. 
▪ 
Providing “office hours” in which teachers are available to students 
virtually or over the phone or email to answer questions, engage in 
discussion, and offer general academic support. 
• 
Schools will provide office hours — via phone, virtual methods or email — during 
regular hours of the school day to answer any questions and support ongoing 
learning. 
  
The primary goal of the district’s remote learning plan is to keep every student engaged and 
connected to their school community through daily learning opportunities. While students 
are expected to complete assignments and schools are able to grade work, grades cannot 
negatively impact any student’s academic standing and incomplete assignments will need to 
be made up following the remote learning period. The guidance is designed to meet the 
needs of individual school communities and includes specific instructions for engaging 
students in temporary living situations, diverse learners and English learners.  
  
While Chicago Public Schools cannot close the digital divide overnight, the district is 
committed to leveraging existing inventory, purchasing new devices for distribution, and 
working with philanthropic partners to help narrow the gap to the best of the district’s 
ability. In order to expand access to remote learning, the district is undertaking an effort to 
deploy more than 100,000 devices to its highest-need students. CPS is working to put more 
devices in the hands of families by moving approximately 65,000 school-based devices into 
homes, allocating 37,000 devices that were recently purchased, and deploying additional 
devices acquired through potential philanthropic contributions. The district will prioritize 
schools with the greatest need based on a hardship index, percentage of students that

PURPOSE
The Office of Violence Reduction and Chicago CRED are requesting YOUR support in fundraising 
for FLIP, a street intervention model that engages high-risk men as mediators and violence 
interrupters. This program is being expanded as a response to the surge in violence in January 
and February of 2020.
We are proposing that YOU and Arne Duncan convene high net worth individuals to pitch FLIP 
and to raise funds for the program. This would occur as a lunch meeting on March 27, 2020.
FLIP OVERVIEW AND EXPANSION
Chicago CRED has developed the FLIP program, which is a specialized form of hyper-localized 
street intervention. FLIP focuses on “hotspots,” which are determined based on police data and
from intelligence gathered by CRED’s street outreach network. FLIP serves as both a violence 
interruption strategy and a summer jobs program for high-risk men. Many FLIP workers are still 
involved in gang life but are looking to get out and are willing to directly
intervene and mediate disputes with men they know.
In 2020, CRED plans to dramatically expand FLIP eight to 10 neighborhoods and from 55 to 100 
hotspots. The target start date is April 1st for most of the communities — acknowledging April 
and May were the most violent months of 2019. They plan to deploy 375 FLIP workers (up 50% 
from 2019) with goal of mediating at least 1,500 conflicts.
The total cost of this program $5.4, with Chicago CRED contributing $1.7 million. $3.4 million in 
additional funding is needed.
The proposed FLIP expansion plan is detailed below. The proposed expansion affords 
programming across same communities last year with experienced implementers, in addition to
expanding to limited new areas on the south and west sides. Criteria for the selection of the 
proposed FLIP districts is as follows:
1. Buy-in from police district
2. Experiencing high levels of violence (within Mayor’s Office public safety priority 15)
3. Street outreach partner willing to implement with model fidelity
4. Street outreach partner has capacity to manage highest-risk individuals
5. Street outreach partner has pre-existing relationships with highest-risk individuals
6. Street outreach partner has fiscal & reporting capacity to appropriately expend funds
7. District/community part of Regional Coordination Tables

LIQUOR SALES AFTER 9 P.M. 
Order strengthens City’s enforcement efforts to prevent social gathering; builds on the 21 citations issued
to eight businesses that have violated the Stay at Home Order
CHICAGO –Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot, the Chicago Police Department (CPD) and the  Department of 
Business Affairs and Consumer Protection (BACP) today announced a temporary Public Health Order 
prohibiting all liquor sales citywide after 9 p.m. each evening as part of the latest measure to prevent 
the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in Chicago’s communities. To further ensure all businesses and
residents are properly complying with Governor Pritzker’s Stay at Home Order, the new measure, 
effective tomorrow evening, Thursday, April 9th, will help prevent congregate activity that has been 
observed across the city near stores that sell alcohol, particularly during evening hours.
This measure builds on ongoing enforcement measures by CPD and BACP to ensure businesses are 
compliant with the latest public health measures to keep residents safe. Recent enforcement measures 
have led to 21 citations issued for up to more than $120,000 in fines for eight businesses violating the 
statewide mandate.
“Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, we have taken every possible step to keep our residents safe, and 
today’s order builds on that effort by further ensuring residents stay at home and therefore, save lives,” 
said Mayor Lightfoot. “Our business owners understand that public safety and public health is more 
important than profit and I want to thank them for not only their patience during this time but most 
importantly, their cooperation and partnership to keep our residents safe.”
Since the Stay at Home order went into effect, CPD has given 1,688 dispersal orders in response to large 
gatherings of residents and has issued 11 citations for up to $5,500 in fines to individuals not adhering to
dispersal orders and violating the Stay at Home Order. This new Public Health Order will give CPD and 
BACP enforcement authority to further curb non-compliance, with potential penalties for liquor sales 
after 9 p.m. including $500 fine, arrest and revocation of liquor and other licenses. Earlier this week, CPD
joined liquor stores on the West Side that agreed voluntarily to close early to encourage people to stay 
home.
""Nothing is more important than making sure Chicago families are safe and healthy,"" said CPD Interim 
Superintendent Charlie Beck. ""Liquor stores across the city have already partnered with us to adjust 
hours and today's order will allow us to expand citywide to further protect Chicagoans from the spread 
of Covid-19.""
Effective March 21, 2020, and recently extended to last through the end of April, Governor Pritzker’s 
Stay at Home Order mandates that only essential businesses, such as grocery stores, banks and 
laundromats, continue operating. Furthermore, the order creates social distancing guidelines that 
essential businesses are required to follow while in operation. Details on the Stay at Home Order, 
including which businesses are considered essential, can be found at www.chicago.gov/coronavirus.

each MBE and WBE included on the Schedule D-1 within five business days after the date of the

or Cook County Illinois, must be submitted with the bid/proposal.  All Letters of Certification

(U) Minor Convictions For Ex-CIA Coder In Hacking Tools Case 
A former CIA software engineer accused of stealing a massive trove of the agency’s hacking tools and handing it over to WikiLeaks was 
convicted of only minor charges Monday, after a jury deadlocked on the more serious espionage counts against him.  Joshua Schulte, who 
worked as a coder at the agency’s headquarters in Langley, Virginia, was convicted by a jury of contempt of court and making false statements 
after a four-week trial in Manhattan federal court.  From Wall Street Journal – snippet view: Jury finds Joshua Schulte guilty of false statements 
and contempt of court but deadlocks on whether he actually gave information to WikiLeaks.  Source: AP News 
 
(U) State Department Pushes To List White Supremacist Group As Terrorist Org 
The State Department is pushing to designate at least one violent white supremacist group as a foreign terrorist organization, an unprecedented 
move that national security experts say would be a big step toward fighting a growing threat on U.S. soil.  Former U.S. officials and 
counterterrorism analysts say the top candidate for the designation is Atomwaffen, a neo-Nazi group that was founded in the United States but 
has expanded into the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and Estonia.  State Department officials want to have the designation finalized by 
next week.  Source: Politico 
 
(U) US Begins Troop Withdrawal From Afghanistan, Official Says 
Army Col. Sonny Leggett, spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement that the U.S. is moving ahead with plans to cut the 
number of forces in the country from about 13,000 to 8,600 over the next four and a half months.  The pullout comes as Afghanistan’s rival 
leaders were each sworn in as president in separate ceremonies Monday, creating a complication for the United States as it figures out how to 
move forward on the deal and end the 18-year war.  The sharpening dispute between President Ashraf Ghani, who was declared the winner of 
last September’s election, and his rival Abdullah Abdullah threatens to wreck the next key steps and even risks devolving into new violence.

OEMC General Message 
Subject: COVID19 Housing 
OVERVIEW: 
OEMC continues to outline housing opportunities as it relates to the COVID19 Coronavirus response.  There is 
currently an anticipated need for both quarantine and isolation housing options. Quarantine housing is utilized by 
individuals who are NOT SICK but have been exposed to COVID19 or are returning from a high risk region. Isolation 
housing is for individuals who have tested POSITIVE for COVID19. 
SUMMARY

Individuals will need to remain in housing until cleared by the Chicago Department of Public Health. This could
be for two or more weeks. 

Information below outlines current options which will be explored for further development 
o
Private Hotel Quarantine Facility near ORD (Contract Signed) 
o
Single Family Housing Options
o
College Dorms (after recent closures)
o
Decommissioned Hospitals
o
Locations identified by the Department of Buildings 
o
Retreat facilities or others identified by the Chicago Archdioceses  
PLANNING

The Housing and Wrap Around Services Committee meets with City, County, State and Private 
Partners daily 

Planning to this point has included all wrap around services to include food, health services and 
screening, recreational services, connectivity, hygiene, mental health and spiritual care, among other 
services needed.  

Currently planning is focused on providing housing to 20 isolated individuals and 20 quarantined 
individuals 

Options will continue to be identified and examined to ensure proper locations are available should they
be need to be scaled to a larger size

After three consecutive years of double-digit declines in shooting and homicides, Chicago is 
seeing a surge in gun violence at the start of 2020. Through February 24, homicides have surged
by 58% while shootings have increased by 20%. The surge is attributed to several factors, 
including:
•
An increase in shooting-related robberies (drug spots, car jackings, etc.)
•
Several internal gang conflicts and an increase in gang vs. gang conflicts.
•
Sporadic shootings and homicides outside typical neighborhoods.
•
The polar vortex may have suppressed 2019 numbers.
FLIP will aid in addressing this increase by expanding from 55 hot spots to 100. While FLIP was 
implemented across 8 communities in 2019, only 6 were high intensity (8 hot spots) due to 
funding limitations, and to allow new outreach partners an opportunity to demonstrate 
capacity (Breakthrough was new to Outreach; and UCAN was new to FLIP but experienced in 
outreach). Based upon 2019 map and 2020 preliminary hot spot data analysis, affording 8-10 
hot spots per community for up to 10 communities is practical.  
FLIP BACKGROUND
FLIP launched in 2018 and achieved the following outcomes:
2018 (pilot)
•
Identified 21 hotspots in three neighborhoods — Austin, Englewood, and West 
Englewood.
•
Coverage spanned June through September. 
•
Cost: $1 million ($100,000 funded by CRED).
•
137 FLIP workers were deployed during high-crime periods — evenings and late nights- 
and mediated 150 conflicts.
2019
•
FLIP strategy increased from three to eight neighborhoods and expanded from 21 to 55 
hotspots.
•
Program spanned from April 16- September
•
Cost: $2.5 million ($1 million funded by CRED).
•
Deployed 249 FLIP workers who mediated 1,121 conflicts.
•
When FLIP teams were working:
o
62% of hotspot areas experienced zero incidents.
o
93% of hotspots experienced less than two incidents.

While we must address the individual needs of our 
residents during this challenging time, it is also important 
that at the City level, we also take a leading role in 
supporting our small businesses. When we support small 
businesses, we support their workers, who in turn help 
uplift the vibrancy of our neighborhoods. 
 
That is why I am proud to announce the creation of the 
Chicago Small Business Resiliency Loan Fund. This Fund 
will start with more than $100 million in targeted, low-
interest loans to severely impacted small businesses.   
 
These loans are designed to provide much needed cash-
flow relief for neighborhood entrepreneurs. This is a 
public-private partnership involving a $25 million-dollar 
grant by the City of Chicago, $50 million in capital by the 
Chicago Community Catalyst Fund, as well as $10 
million from Goldman Sachs’ Urban Investment Group.   
 
Thanks to City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin for her 
partnership in this effort, as well as the Goldman team. 
 
I need to also acknowledge and thank Fifth Third Bank 
who has pledged $1 million to the Fund, as well as Bob

Dear Reentry Housing Task Force Members,

Task Force Members: 
Hon. Mattie Hunter 
Many of us have been working diligently over the past several weeks to address the problems 
presented by the unprecedented circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The 
hardship shared by many is magnified many times over for those who are incarcerated. And a 
substantial obstacle to moving people out of incarceration is the lack of housing—especially 
supportive housing. 
Hon. Lindsey LaPointe 
Hon. Lindsay Parkhurst 
Hon. Chuck Weaver 
Mark Angelini 
Betsy Benito 
Deanne Benos 
While everyone has more than enough to do, we have heard from a number of people in the field 
that they would like a venue where people from around the state who are engaged in the issue 
can share information and understand what steps are being taken to address the problem of 
housing for people who are incarcerated. They have pointed out that the Task Force is 
comprised of both criminal justice and housing officials and advocates who are working to 
address a common problem and that there is not currently another venue where these groups 
from around the state are communicating. 
Deborah Bennett 
David Brint 
Yaacov Delaney 
Victor Dickson 
For that reason, we are hosting a Zoom conference call on Friday, April 17 at 8:00am, for only 
one hour, to share information and solutions. This is intended to be a one-time event, but it may 
result in communication later among people who are on the call.

Ahmadou Dramè 
Mary Ann Dyar

Nancy Firfer 
Jane Genzel 
While the COVID crisis has moved our focus to moving people out of jails, detention centers and 
prisons right now, we also believe it illustrates the profound problem that has existed for a long 
time— it is extremely difficult to find housing — and support, if necessary—for many people 
leaving incarceration.  What we learn now will inform our Task Force going forward. While the 
crisis may slow down the Task Force work a little, we intend to keep the Task Force moving with 
the benefit of what we learn in the short term—and with your support.

If you have specific things you want to share with the group in advance, please send materials 
to Jenny Green at jenny@iljp.org and they will be distributed prior to the call. We encourage you 
to invite other people to join the call, but please let Jenny know so we can be sure we have a 
manageable number of participants. We hope you will join us.

editorials in the Sun-Times and Tribune to further validate the new public health order given 
the continued large gatherings outside liquor stores at night. Both the Chicago Tribune and Sun-
Times have reached out this week already about the latest enforcement efforts by the City to 
ensure businesses and residents are following the Stay At Home order. The Mayor’s Office is 
also going to work with the local liquor store owners attending tomorrow to conduct interviews
with media to amplify the City’s message that we are working owners in partnership rather 
than doing this as punitive measure.  
As part of the digital strategy, YOU will film a PSA with Commissioner Escareno on the new 
public health order, which will launch following your press announcement. On their own social 
media channels, BACP will communicate the new curfew via their social media channels and 
work to amplify the message through validators in the business community such as the Illinois 
Retail Merchants Association and local Chambers of Commerce. Furthermore, CPD 
Communications Department will utilize their media car to film a digital PSA with a community 
liquor store to help amplify the new order on their social media channels.
OUTREACH PLAN:
As part of tomorrow’s announcement, the Mayor’s Office is working in partnership with BACP 
and CPD on an extensive outreach plan to further ensure full compliance of the new public 
health order. 
Mayor’s Office/Aldermen 
IGA in partnership with BACP will be distributing an email with a copy of the new public health 
order to all aldermen notifying them about the liquor sales curfew. As part of the email, they’ll 
include who aldermen should contact at BACP should any business in the ward be in violation 
and also a copy of the new signage that liquor-licensed businesses should display in their stores 
to communicate the order with their patrons.  
The Mayor’s Office’s community engagement team will be working with BACP and CPD on 
targeted outreach to faith partners, local chambers and business associations in neighborhoods
that have seen large gatherings of residents outside liquor stores at night.
BACP
To further amplify the Department’s efforts to promote safe business operations and shopping 
during COVID-19, BACP will distribute an email to all businesses with an extensive FAQ on 
Worker’s Rights and the latest CDPH guidance for businesses and employers. In this email, BACP
will note that Andy Fox, Director of OLS, will host a webinar on Thursday at 2pm for businesses 
and employers to know their responsibilities and rights, including what to do if an employee 
gets COVID-19.

COVID-19 Press Conference
April 2, 2020
 Good morning.
 I am here to announce the painful news that – for 
the second time in two days – Chicago has lost 
another City employee to the COVID-19 virus.
 This time it was an officer in our Chicago Police 
Department.
 Since the moment this crisis arrived at our city, it 
has been our healthcare workers and first 
responders like this officer who have been putting 
their lives on the line every day to fight this virus 
and keep Chicagoans safe.
 Tragically, this officer gave his life to that fight.
 Our hearts go out to this individual’s family, friends
and fellow officers whose lives have been forever 
changed by this terrible loss.

 And these numbers will worsen before they improve.
 That is why I ask – once again – for all Chicagoans 
to Stay Home and Save Lives.
 What you do matters. Every time you go outside 
matters.
 The more Chicagoans stay in, the sooner this crisis 
will end, the more lives will be spared, and the 
sooner we can move our city forward from this 
terrible event.
 This officer was an example of what our health care 
professionals, essential workers, and first 
responders are doing every day to serve our city by 
keeping it running and keeping us safe.
 It’s your job to support them by Staying Home.
 Thank you.

5.00 – Respect
6.00 – Restraint
We hold life in the highest 
regard. We treat all citizens and 
colleagues with dignity and 
respect, and are fair and impartial 
as we perform our duties.
We use the minimum force and 
authority necessary to accomplish a 
proper police purpose. We demon-
strate self-discipline, even when no 
one is listening or watching.
4.04 
Supervisors shall be role models for 
delivering truly professional, impartial 
and effective police service. Supervi-
sors shall ensure that the individuals 
for whom they are responsible carry 
out their professional duties correctly. 
Supervisors must put the 
department’s mission first, in both 
word and action, and do nothing to 
interfere with its accomplishment.  
Core 
Values 
and 
Guiding 
Principles
6.01 
Police members shall exercise restraint 
in the use of force and act in propor-
tion to the seriousness of the offense 
and the legitimate law enforcement 
objective to be achieved.
5.01 
Department members shall treat the 
public and each other with courtesy 
and professionalism. Civility and 
patience are valued attributes, while 
profane or insolent language or actions 
undermine the public’s confidence.
5.02 
Members shall act with fairness, 
self-control, tolerance and impartiality 
when carrying out their duties.
6.02 
Members shall not subject any person 
to torture or cruel, inhumane or 
degrading treatment or punishment. 
No circumstances whatsoever may 
be invoked as a justification for torture 
or other cruel, inhumane or degrading 
treatment or punishment.
5.03 
Members shall promptly obey any 
proper or lawful order emanating from 
any officer of higher rank. Any 
improper or unlawful order should be 
reported to a supervisor of higher rank.
4.05 
Supervisors shall ensure the individuals 
for whom they are responsible are 
supported, guided on the professional 
performance of their duties and 
encouraged to further their profes-
sional development. Supervisors have 
a particular responsibility to secure, 
promote, improve and maintain 
professional standards and integrity 
through the provision of advice and 
guidance. Supervisors have an 
obligation to commend exemplary 
behavior, a responsibility to correct 
substandard behavior and a require-
ment to discipline when needed.
5.04 
A conflicting order shall be brought to 
the attention of the member giving the 
order. If this member does not change 
the order, the order shall stand and this 
member shall bear full responsibility.

Dallas, leading the city to become a national leader in policing reforms as the Dallas Police 
Department became the first in the United States to institute department-wide de-escalation 
training for officers. Additionally, as Chief, Brown implemented implicit bias training, brought 
body cameras to Dallas and instituted reforms that expanded mental wellness supports for 
officers, increased diversity within the Department and published never-before-released use-of-
force and officer-involved shooting data.
On July 7, 2016, Brown was thrust into the national spotlight after a lone gunman shot and 
killed four Dallas police officers, one Dallas Area Rapid Transit officer, and injured seven more 
officers and two civilians during a peaceful protest march in downtown Dallas. Following the 
national tragedy, Brown’s leadership helped heal a grieving city and bridge a gap between the 
city’s officers and the communities they serve.

MEDIA RELEASE  Contact Larry langford 773 492 2001
April 20,2020
After a review of all pertinent information available, Fire Commissioner Richard C. Ford II  has 
determined  the deaths of CFD members Mario Araujo and Edward Singleton will be classified as Line 
of Duty Deaths (LODD). This determination will allow full city benefits to the surviving family.
Any death of a CFD member will be reviewed on a case by case basis  for determination of LODD 
status. 
 Fire Commissioner Ford II added; “Our current situation is unprecedented in the history of our 
department and will be addressed accordingly. These two members made the ultimate sacrifice to   
protect those whom they swore an oath to serve. We will not forget our obligation to their families in 
this time of crisis.”
LODD status assures the family of continued income and other benefits as authorized by the City."

“Starting today, Chicago is now home for my family, and I promise to never stop working to make it a

Beck will continue to provide support to Acting Superintendent Brown over the next several months to 
ensure a smooth transition process. In addition, First Deputy Superintendent Riccio will work with 
Brown on the Department’s ongoing public health efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 while also 
sustaining citywide crimefighting operations to prevent and reduce crime in Chicago. Following City 
Council approval later this month, Brown will be officially appointed as the Superintendent of the

SALES COMPARISON APPROACH 
 
 
Sales Comparison Approach Value Indication – Hospital Facility Only 
From the market data available, we used health care sales in competitive market areas which were 
adjusted based on pertinent elements of comparison. The following table summarizes the unadjusted 
and adjusted sale prices: 
 
Improved Sales Statistics

Overall, the comparables ranged in adjusted price per square foot from $34.06 to $82.78 per square 
foot, with an average indication of $59.10 per square foot. Based on this evidence, a price per square 
foot indication modestly below the average is considered reasonable for the subject’s hospital 
component only, given the subject’s overall age and location. 
Supplemental Medical Office Sale Comparables 
Due to a lack of information regarding medical office spaces within the primary set of sales 
comparables, we have provided supplemental office sales in order to demonstrate market trends for 
similar medical office spaces. The following chart summarizes our findings:

SALES COMPARISON APPROACH 
 
 
Market Conditions Adjustment 
Market conditions change over time because of inflation, deflation, fluctuations in supply and demand, 
or other factors. Changing market conditions may create a need for adjustment to comparable sale 
transactions completed during periods of dissimilar market conditions.  The sale comparables 
represent recent sale transactions and current listings near the date of value with no market conditions 
adjustments necessary. 
Property Adjustments 
Property adjustments are usually expressed quantitatively as percentages or dollar amounts that reflect 
the differences in value attributable to the various characteristics of the property. In some instances, 
however, qualitative adjustments are used. These adjustments are based on locational and physical 
characteristics and are applied after the application of transaction and market conditions adjustments.  
Our reasoning for the property adjustments made to each sale comparable follows. The discussion will 
analyze each adjustment category deemed applicable to the subject property. 
Location 
Location adjustments may be required when the locational characteristics of a comparable are different 
from those of the subject. These characteristics can include general neighborhood characteristics, 
freeway accessibility, street exposure, corner- versus interior-lot location, neighboring properties, view 
amenities, and other factors.  The subject property is located along Gregory Street with average access 
and average visibility. Downward adjustments were applied to Sale Comparables One and Two as they 
are located within more densely populated sections of the Chicago MSA, with greater abilities to draw 
upon the nearby local population totals for future patients. Conversely, positive adjustments were 
applied to Sale Comparbles Three through Five as they are located within less densely populated 
market areas. 
Size 
The size adjustment addresses variance in the net rentable area of the comparables and that of the 
subject, as a larger building typically commands a lower sale price per unit than a smaller building. 
This inverse relationship is due, in part, to the principle of “economies of scale.” Downward adjustments 
were applied to Sale Comparables One, Three, and Five as they are significantly smaller than the subject 
property. 
Age/Condition 
All else being equal, older properties typically command a lower price per square foot than newer 
properties. However, although a property may be physically older than another property, the effective 
age may be similar to a newer property and no adjustment may be indicated. This may be due to the 
older property being well maintained or a recent renovation. We based the adjustments to the 
comparables on effective age rather than physical age. This takes the overall condition of a property 
into consideration. Positive adjustments were applied to Sale Comparables One and Three as they have 
older construction dates as compared to the subject property. Conversely, downward adjustments 
were applied to Sale Comparables Two, Four, and Five as they have overall newer construction dates 
as compared to the subject property.

Analysis/Comments on Improvements 
The improvements are in average overall condition and are considered to be typical for the age and 
location in regard to improvement design and layout, as well as, interior and exterior amenities. The 
subject property has very good functional utility for a variety of uses. Overall, there are no known 
factors that adversely impact the marketability of the improvements. The functional utility of the 
property is good for its current use based upon a comparison of similar properties in the market area. 
The functional utility of the property is rated as adequate and designed for its current use based upon 
a comparison of similar properties in the market area.

REGIONAL AND MARKET AREA ANALYSIS 
 
 
 
An expanded downtown district, defined as the Central Area by the City for planning purposes, covers 
the area generally bounded by North Avenue (1600 North), Halsted Street (800 West), Cermak Road 
(2200 South) and the lake.  This expanded area is roughly the equivalent to all of the community area 
designated by the City of Chicago as The Loop, most of the Near North Side Community area, and 
part of the Near South Side.  
 
Chicago’s Central Area is estimated to contain approximately 40% to 45% of the city’s total workforce.  
Also located within this district area the city’s dense concentration of high-rise office and 
apartment/condominium buildings, numerous hotels, The Art Institute, Millennium Park, Navy Pier (the 
city’s most visited tourist attraction), stage theaters, municipal, county and federal government offices, 
and the internationally known as the “Magnificent Mile” shopping district. 
Transportation 
Chicago is one of the primary transportation hubs in the United States. Its extensive transportation 
facilities give local firms ready access to national and international markets and suppliers, as well as 
provide travelers with convenient traveling alternatives. 
 
Several major interconnected expressways and interstate highways pass through the Chicago area. 
Interstates 88 and 290 are the main east-west routes, providing access from the central business district 
to the east and the Quad Cities to the west. Interstate 55 provides access to the southwestern suburban 
areas and eventually the city of St. Louis. Communities to the north and northwest are accessed via 
Interstates 90 and 94. North-south travel between the western suburbs is facilitated by Interstates 294 
and 355. With ten interstate freeways consisting of some 630 miles, Chicago is one of the best-
connected cities in the nation and a primary hub of the trucking industry. To the south, Interstate 80 
corridor traverses the entire country east to west and is a significant highway for commerce and 
tourism. 
 
O’Hare International Airport is the second busiest airport in the world serving over 79.8 million 
domestic and international passengers via over 867,049 flights annually as of 2017. In addition, O’Hare 
handles nearly 1.9 million tons of cargo per year. Midway Airport, located in Chicago’s southwest side, 
serves as a secondary airport and has become an increasingly popular alternative to O’Hare. Presently, 
Midway serves nearly 22.4 million passengers through nearly 251,341 flights annually. In addition, a 
number of smaller private airports dot the suburban areas. 
 
In February of 2018, the city of Chicago announced an expansion of the O’Hare’s passenger area, with 
dozens of new gates and 3 million square feet of terminal space, to be added by 2026. There will be 
new gates for O’Hare’s dominant carriers, American and United, as well as discount carriers, new 
international space that would allow baggage to go directly to domestic gates, additions to club space 
for frequent fliers and construction of a 10,000-space employee parking lot on the western edge of 
the airport. Overall, terminal space will increase from 4.3 million square feet to 7.4 million square feet. 
The cost of the expansion is estimated at $8.54 billion.  
 
In March of 2018, the Chicago Department of Aviation (CDA) announced that they are implementing 
a nearly $400 million capital improvement program over the next three years at Midway International 
Airport that will significantly upgrade the travel experience for years to come. The Midway

RECONCILIATION 
 
 
Consideration of Recent Transactions 
The subject property is currently under contract for sale. Our final opinion of market value is higher 
than the pending contract due to the distressed nature of the subject property.  
Exposure Time and Marketing Periods 
Based on statistical information about days on market, escrow length, and marketing times gathered 
through national investor surveys, sales verification, and interviews of market participants, marketing 
and exposure time estimates of 9 to 12 months and 9 to 12 months, respectively, are considered 
reasonable and appropriate for the subject property.

GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS & LIMITING CONDITIONS 
 
 
22. 
Our inspection included an observation of the land and improvements thereon only. It was not 
possible to observe conditions beneath the soil or hidden structural components within the 
improvements. We inspected the buildings involved, and reported damage (if any) by termites, dry 
rot, wet rot, or other infestations as a matter of information, and no guarantee of the amount or 
degree of damage (if any) is implied. Condition of heating, cooling, ventilation, electrical and 
plumbing equipment is considered to be commensurate with the condition of the balance of the 
improvements unless otherwise stated. Should the client have concerns in these areas, it is the 
client’s responsibility to order the appropriate inspections. The appraiser does not have the skill or 
expertise to make such inspections and assumes no responsibility for these items. 
23. 
This appraisal does not guarantee compliance with building code and life safety code requirements 
of the local jurisdiction. It is assumed that all required licenses, consents, certificates of occupancy 
or other legislative or administrative authority from any local, state or national governmental or 
private entity or organization have been or can be obtained or renewed for any use on which the 
value conclusion contained in this report is based unless specifically stated to the contrary. 
24. 
When possible, we have relied upon building measurements provided by the client, owner, or 
associated agents of these parties. In the absence of a detailed rent roll, reliable public records, or 
“as-built” plans provided to us, we have relied upon our own measurements of the subject 
improvements. We follow typical appraisal industry methods; however, we recognize that some 
factors may limit our ability to obtain accurate measurements including, but not limited to, property 
access on the day of inspection, basements, fenced/gated areas, grade elevations, 
greenery/shrubbery, uneven surfaces, multiple story structures, obtuse or acute wall angles, 
immobile obstructions, etc. Professional building area measurements of the quality, level of detail, 
or accuracy of professional measurement services are beyond the scope of this appraisal 
assignment.  
25. 
We have attempted to reconcile sources of data discovered or provided during the appraisal 
process, including assessment department data. Ultimately, the measurements that are deemed by 
us to be the most accurate and/or reliable are used within this report. While the measurements and 
any accompanying sketches are considered to be reasonably accurate and reliable, we cannot 
guarantee their accuracy. Should the client desire more precise measurement, they are urged to 
retain the measurement services of a qualified professional (space planner, architect or building 
engineer) as an alternative source. If this alternative measurement source reflects or reveals 
substantial differences with the measurements used within the report, upon request of the client, 
the appraiser will submit a revised report for an additional fee. 
26. 
In the absence of being provided with a detailed land survey, we have used assessment department 
data to ascertain the physical dimensions and acreage of the property. Should a survey prove this 
information to be inaccurate, upon request of the client, the appraiser will submit a revised report 
for an additional fee. 
27. 
If only preliminary plans and specifications were available for use in the preparation of this appraisal, 
and a review of the final plans and specifications reveals substantial differences upon request of 
the client the appraiser will submit a revised report for an additional fee.

Subject: Records request.
Good afternoon,
It’s Jeremy Gorner from the Chicago Tribune.
I’m filing a request under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 
for records sufficient to show the number of citations issued by Chicago police officers for 
violations of Gov. J.B. Pritzker's stay­at­home order that went into effect at 5 p.m. March 21, 
2020.
In addition to the number of citations, I'd like to request records sufficient to show the 
locations of the alleged infractions forming the basis for the written citations broken down by 
address of occurrence, patrol district and beat, the dates and times of the incidents, the 
names, ages and home addresses of each person cited (unless, of course, they're juveniles), 
the citation numbers, the specific violations forming the basis for the citations and the fine 
amounts. 
I'm also requesting records sufficient to show the number of dispersals by Chicago police 
officers from 5 p.m. March 21, 2020 to the present (March 31, 2020). I'm also requesting the 
dates, times and locations ­­ broken down by address of occurrence, patrol district and beat ­­ 
for each Chicago police dispersal.  
If there is information that I have requested in this FOIA that is going to be withheld from me, 
please do not withhold this FOIA request in its entirety.
If in your view any of the above records contain information you deem to be exempt from 
disclosure under the privacy 7(1) (c) or work product 7 (1) (f) provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act please redact that portion of the record and provide the remainder, 
specifying the precise nature of the redacted information and the specific exemption in 
which you would rely in the event I was to ask for its disclosure.

due to factors outside of our control as illustrated by the survey responses

Usability Testing
We also conducted two usability tests. One was 
prior to development to understand if participants 
found the app design user-friendly and intuitive. 
The second usability test focused on updating the 
alert feature. There was a total of 14 participants in 
the first study, and 5 participants in the second. In 
the first usability study, we walked the participants 
through each feature of the app, and we asked 
them to give feedback. During the second usability 
testing session, we asked participants to complete 
several tasks using a prototype of the newly de-
signed alert feature and analyzed their usage and 
feedback.
Suggestions from the usability testing were incor-
surveys, with 56 respondents sufficiently complet-
ing both surveys. Reasons for the differences in 
survey responses were that some participants no 
longer worked for the organization by the end of 
the study; there were new hires during the study; 
one site (Englewood) unexpectedly closed down; 
and we had difficulty reaching certain participants.
 Interviews
In addition to surveys, we conducted pre and post 
interviews with 18 participants (i.e., 2-3 from each 
site). Interviewees were selected based on their 
length of time as violence prevention workers and 
their comfort with technology; we selected novices 
and experts in both areas. 
porated in the updated versions of the app. For ex-
ample, the initial version of the application did not 
include the Connect feature, which allows users to 
connect directly with each other and share photos. 
After the initial usability testing session, we added 
that feature to help facilitate social capital building 
amongst violence prevention workers. Another 
example of how we incorporated feedback from 
the usability testing into app design was when we 
modified the alert feature to allow senders to  write 
a short description of their situation, to allow alert 
receivers to quickly inform the alert sender if they 
are on the way or not, and to allow alert senders 
the ability update the location of their alert while 
the situation is in progress.
To analyze the interview data, we conducted in-
ductive qualitative analysis techniques, where we 
read each interview transcript line-by-line and add 
descriptions (codes) to understand patterns in the 
data. The codes are then grouped into higher level 
categories in order to identify patterns or themes 
that emerge from the data.
Findings
This section provides findings from the three-
month deployment of the app. Built on the An-
droid platform initially, the application was de-
ployed in six communities during April, May, and 
June 2018. The violence prevention sites were 
located in South Shore, North Lawndale, Auburn 
Gresham, East Garfield Park, East Englewood, and 
West Englewood. We also surveyed workers in 
Grand Crossing but only as a control site to allow us 
Log/Trace Data
Usage of the app was recorded and saved for 
further analysis, including but not limited to each 
feature that was used, the messages sent, and 
training videos watched. We use the aggregated 
data to help describe and learn about app usage. 
The purpose of the trace data is to understand us-
age while also comparing usage to mediation logs 
in the Civicore database.

ing, the strategies and stuff like that.” (P1)
Not having an iPhone version of the app made 
using the app less appealing for participants whose 
coworkers owned iPhones.
Participants also felt that they needed more prac-
tice with app and that he had trouble remember-
ing all the features and what they were for, and 
wanted more training on it. 
“So I’m the only one here, and everybody 
with iPhones is like ... I go on periodically just 
to check out everybody else’s, but I won’t be 
using it like that, ‘cause in my mind, I got my 
mind like, ‘[...] Everybody don’t have it.’” (p10)
“I’m not gonna lie. Like I say a lot of times 
I actually— I am being honest with you, I 
forget about all the tools that this app has.” 
(P7)
“And then I think probably so that the  
iPhones haven’t been connected yet. That’s 
taking a large group out of it. [..] I think it’s 
maybe one other person [on the app at my 
site] if I’m not mistaken[...]
       “If you new and you haven’t 
been through the training, and 
even if you have been through the 
training, everybody, you just can’t 
remember everything.” (P14)
“
       [...] And everybody else got  
iPhones in the office, so that’s like 
a big disconnect right there.” (P11)
“
The fact that the app was not required or  
encouraged by management was also described 
as a reason why some did not use it. Sites where 
the supervisors encouraged people to post on the 
connect feed had higher usage.
“‘Even if we make it a little competitive, 
friendly competing. Man, this what we 
doing over here. I just think if something 
reached our leaders, our team leaders or 
whatever, just kind of every meeting, just 
bring it up. “Man, have you been doing 
this?” We’ll sit down and just mess with 
Evaluating Measurable Outcomes  
using Log Data and Surveys
In addition to our qualitative and quantitative 
analysis where we use surveys, log data, and inter-
views to understand usage and attitudinal behav-
ior about the app, in this section we attempt to 
evaluate the proposed outcomes created by Cure 
Violence in relationship to each of the mobile app’s 
features. Though we gave our best efforts to evalu-
ate these hypotheses, there are major issues with 
consistency and anonymolies in the Cure Violence 
database, and we never received the mediation 
it to get more familiar with it, make it a 
norm, ‘cause everybody familiar.” (P10)
“Well if I didn’t have to, I would never use it.” 
(P3)
data from other organizations that was to be facil-
itated by Cure Violence’s Director of Research and 
Evaluation. Despite these challenges, below are the 
results of our evaluation based on the data that we 
have.
Customized guidance
“You know, so that’s the reason why we  
haven’t really been using, like you know 
what they - Ain’t nobody really like made 
it like, “Use this to communicate.”... I mean 
seriously I think y’all should say, “This is 
mandatory, we need to use this while we 
on the clock.” (P18)
Proposed Outcome 1: Usage
The phone app’s “customized guidance”  
feature will be used in 60% of total conflict 
mediations (evidenced by conflict media-
tions entered in centralized database and 
phone app tracking mechanism).

Illinois’ Prison Wardens and County Sheriffs, 
  
In light of the expansion of the threat of COVID 19 and the increased vulnerability and capacity 
for transmission in carceral facilities, we know that you are working diligently to prevent the 
spread of COVID 19 in your facilities and to prepare your facility for how to respond should 
there be an outbreak. 
  
As you make those preparations, we request that you include: 
• 
protocols for providing to all those in your facility preventative materials such as hand 
sanitizers, disinfectant wipes, soap, etc;   
• a provision for quarantining anyone who tests positive for the virus at a hospital, not at 
the prison or jail; 
• a commitment that at no point will a facility be locked down or closed off to outsiders to 
be considered in their entirety as places of “quarantine.” Family members and lawyers 
must maintain access to their clients and loved ones. 
  
This letter is one of a package of letters sent to Illinois authorities with whom our state entrusts 
the care of incarcerated people. The primary letter is written to Governor Pritzker, requesting 
that he consider immediately ordering a review of all people in Illinois prisons and jails who are 
elderly or infirm, with an eye toward providing medical furloughs or compassionate release to 
as many of them as possible. 
  
We thank you for your concern for those entrusted to your care. 
  
Sincerely Yours, 
Illinois Coalition for Higher Education in Prison 
and 1,587 additional individuals and organizations, as of March 12, 2020 at 12pm.

Multinational Logistics Company 
(U//FOUO)  Scope. This Intelligence Note informs federal, state, local, and private sector network defenders of the 
compromise and exfiltration of data by advanced persistent threat (APT) cyber actors. The information cutoff date for 
this Note is 4 February 2020. 
(U//FOUO)  Prepared by the DHS Intelligence Enterprise (DHS IE) Cyber Mission Center (CYMC). Coordinated with the Cybersecurity 
and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and FBI.  
(U//FOUO)  APT cyber actors from mid-January 2019 to early January 2020 continuously targeted or 
compromised at least 60 accounts hosted on a multinational logistics company’s e-mail server, according to a 
defense report.1 The cyber actors from 4-10 January 2020 used the Singapore-based IP address 
103[.]140[.]186[.]27 to acquire at least 548 MB of information on business transactions between the company 
and worldwide maritime government customers, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, 
according to the same report.  
(U) Reporting Computer Security Incidents
(U) To report a computer security incident, either contact CISA at 888-282-0870, or go to https://forms.us-
cert.gov/report/ and complete the CISA Incident Reporting System form. The CISA Incident Reporting System
provides a secure, web-enabled means of reporting computer security incidents to CISA. An incident is defined as a
violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard computer
security practices. In general, types of activity commonly recognized as violating typical security policies include
attempts (either failed or successful) to gain unauthorized access to a system or its data, including personally
identifiable information; unwanted disruption or denial of service; the unauthorized use of a system for processing or
storing data; and changes to system hardware, firmware, or software without the owner’s knowledge, instruction, or
consent.
(U) To report this incident to the Intelligence Community, please contact your DHS I&A Field Operations officer at
your state or major urban area fusion center, or e-mail DHS.INTEL.FOD.HQ@hq.dhs.gov. DHS I&A Field Operations
officers are forward deployed to every US state and territory and support state, local, tribal, territorial, and private
sector partners in their intelligence needs; they ensure any threats, incidents, or suspicious activity is reported to the
Intelligence Community for operational awareness and analytic consumption.

Assumptions:
1. Activities outside the household reduced by 80% for adults when Stay-At-Home (SAH) order takes effect. 
2. Ease stay-at-home home restrictions gradually over 30 days beginning May 1, June 1 and July 1.
3. People practice social distancing and reduce the possibility of transmission when having contact by 50% compared to normal.
(Behavioral Adjustment 0.5: transmissibility reduced to 50% of normal due to social distancing, masks, etc.)
4. Schools do not reopen until September. Children gradually resume having normal social contact when easing begins.
Observations:  Under these assumptions, a second exposure peak is reduced by delaying the easing of restrictions. 
We have run other scenarios with other assumptions on (1) length of the easing period, (2) reduction of adult activity during SAH, (3) behavioral 
adjustments due to social distancing, and the (4) degree of child social contact.

downturn, and the spike in violence — is for Chicago to address the underlying systems
of inequity and racism that fuel them. It is not by coincidence that more African 
American and Latinx Chicagoans contracted and died from COVID-19, or that more 
communities of color have faced economic hardship both before and during this time, or
that African American and Latinx communities bear the brunt of violence and ineffective 
policing. Put simply, without addressing the root causes of disinvestment, poverty, and 
inequitable social policies, Chicago’s violence reduction efforts will fail. Addressing 
these root causes of violence will take years of sustained effort and coordinated 
partnership with diverse stakeholders.
The first steps toward sustainable violence reduction focus on interventions that will 
ensure a basic level of safety by decreasing shootings, accelerating police reform 
priorities, and building a basic violence reduction infrastructure. This infrastructure must 
be located in the communities most impacted by violence, where it can then intervene in
cycles of violence and empower and heal people. As we work to achieve this basic level
of safety, we will simultaneously work to scale services to meet the true need and to 
ensure equitable access to opportunities. To maximize impact, the currently siloed 
efforts by different stakeholders and providers must be brought under a unified strategy 
through intentional coordination of programs and resources.
 
Recent violence reduction work in Chicago
The public health approach outlined in this plan has been embraced by many in 
Chicago for some time. We have seen elements of this framework occurring in many 
different capacities for decades. Notably, in 2016, the City began to see more 
intentional coordination as many stakeholders sought out best practices from within 
Chicago, from other jurisdictions, and through evidence based research to seek new 
ways to address violence.
The Police Accountability Task Force (PATF),6 which paved the way for Chicago Police 
Department (CPD) reform and the current consent decree driven efforts, spurred a 
group of philanthropic organizations coming together as the Partnership for Safe and 
Peaceful Communities (PSPC)7 to invest in reducing violence and improving police 
legitimacy. As part of their work, PSPC has supported the activation of a network of gun
violence prevention and intervention groups working on the South and West sides of 
Chicago.8 
 
Additionally, City, State, and County partners, along with philanthropy, have aligned 
around similar approaches to violence reduction, strengthening the community based 
violence reduction infrastructure in 33 neighborhoods. These efforts are responsive to 
the communities that have been leading violence prevention work for years and asking

Ongoing and completed priorities:

In 2019, the City and the Chicago Police Department (CPD) expanded the Westside Narcotics 
Diversion Intervention, which is a pre-arrest deflection strategy to respond to the opioid crisis to 
three additional police districts on the West side of Chicago. The program systematically 
connects individuals experiencing substance use disorder to treatment through the service 
provider, Thresholds, which is co-located at police district stations in addition to serving walk-in 
clients. 

In 2020, the City and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) invested $6 million in a 
network of street outreach organizations to support their work to deescalate conflicts and prevent 
potentially violent retaliation. 

In 2020, the City allocated an additional $400,000 to support justice system diversion 
opportunities for youth at highest risk 

In 2020, the City and CDPH, building on best practices and coordinating with street outreach 
services, invested $1.5 million in developing a network of trauma-informed victim services 
organizations to ensure individuals impacted by violence have access to resources and supports 
they need.49 The Mayor’s Office and CDPH are collaborating to offer comprehensive trainings for 
providers on trauma and how to utilize a trauma-informed, victim-centered approach when 
providing victims and families services.

During the COVID-19 Stay at Home Order, the City helped to facilitate a partnership with 
rideshare companies, Lyft and Uber, to help victims of domestic violence to get from point A to 
point B safely.

The City allocated $207,000 from the CARES Act to the Department of Family and Support 
Services (DFSS) to increase the capacity of the Illinois domestic violence hotline, as well as 
domestic violence shelters. 

The City is allocating over $4 million in CARES Act funding to violence reduction activities, 
including street outreach expansion and capacity building for smaller community-based 
organizations. These funds are a response to the exacerbation of violence that has accompanied 
the COVID-19 pandemic. 
49 In addition to the ongoing initiatives, the Mayor’s Office of Violence Reduction is also working to assist victim 
services partners with increasing access to resources and specific supports for victims of community violence who 
are also a part of the LGBTQ+ community. Partner capacity to serve victims in the LGBTQ+ community will be 
enhanced through training on trauma-informed practices with this population.

In summer 2020, the Mayor’s Office Education and Human Services team (EDHS) launched a 
cross-departmental “On the Block” mobile services pilot anchored on the Chicago Park District’s 
summer “Rollin’ Rec” program that brings services and resources to residents in communities of 
need. This approach promotes collaboration across departments and increases engagement 
between government and residents. Each of the 18 neighborhood blocks served during the 6-
week summer pilot were selected by the Chicago Police Department (CPD) based on violent 
activity and summer safety priorities. Programming included recreational activities, job and 
employment services, disability services, voter registration, CityKey, mask giveaways, and more.

The Mayor’s Office has focused engagement and resources in the West Garfield Park 
neighborhood along Pulaski Road between the green and blue line stops. The City partnered with
CPD and other service providers to distribute food, share information about city resources, and 
provide education about opioid use disorder. These efforts are ongoing and are aimed at 
promoting community engagement and reclaiming community space from violence. are aimed at 
promoting community engagement and reclaiming community space from violence.

In summer 2020, CPD launched two new citywide teams that focus on combatting violent crime, 
strengthening community relationships, and ensuring the safety of residents during large-scale 
events, marches, and demonstrations.  The Community Safety Team and the Critical Incident 
Response Team can be deployed to the places that need them most to ensure that violence is 
responded to quickly and drivers of violence are held accountable, ensuring that communities are
kept safe.
Short-term initiatives:

Prioritize funding for violence intervention and victim services in underserved communities and 
end service deserts.

Identify opportunities for infrastructure improvements in communities most impacted by violence.

Identify funding opportunities to increase and support effective gun violence reduction programs 
that serve communities most impacted by violence to expand existing programs and to respond 
nimbly to changing violence dynamics and geographies (e.g. emerging concentration of violence, 
intensifying group conflicts).

Coordinate citywide safe public space strategies to ensure coverage in the areas most impacted 
by violence

Use community design techniques such as strategically located greenery, optimizing the potential
of public buildings, and increasing lighting to build spaces that are safer for residents.

Coordinate with other placed-based violence reduction investments across sectors such as the 
State’s Restore, Reinvest, and Renew (R3) initiative and Partnership for Safe and Peaceful 
Communities.

Assess program design, governance, and scalability of “On the Block” mobile services pilot as 
well as raise resources in advance of its next phase to support implementation and branding of 
initiative.

Engage with communities to identify use cases for vacant parcels in neighborhoods impacted by 
violence, either for targeted investment (e.g., parks improvements or additional lighting, etc.) or 
for redevelopment in the form of tree planting, sustainable clean-up, community programming, 
etc. to help revitalize some of the city’s most underserved communities.
Long-term initiatives:

Implement large-scale and community-driven improvements to the built environment in 
communities most impacted by violence.

Grow local service capacity based on community needs.

Scale “On the Block” mobile services pilot to reach more residents and communities in need.

The City’s duty to ensure the safety of all its residents means that any violence is 
unacceptable. Far too many Chicagoans continue to experience the devastating loss 
and trauma that result from violence. In striving to meet this obligation, the City faces 
three especially challenging situations. First, relative to other cities, Chicago suffers 
disproportionately from gun violence, as opposed to violent crimes not involving 
firearms. Second, violence is only one facet of the racial inequity that persists in 
Chicago and intertwines with other manifestations of inequity such as disparities in 
health, poverty, and educational outcomes that fuel violence and feed a sense of 
hopelessness. As a result, the extraordinary levels of violence in the South and West 
sides of Chicago have become commonplace, and a sense of urgency and outrage is 
needed to galvanize an intentional response. Third, these challenges are further 
complicated by a widespread collapse in the perceived legitimacy in the Chicago Police 
Department. Although reform efforts are ongoing and robust, the lack of trust in police, 
particularly in the communities most impacted by violence, hampers any effort to 
achieve community safety.
Chicago experiences devastating levels of violence
Each year, Chicago experiences devastating levels of violence that disproportionately 
affect communities of color. Compared to the past 20 years, 2016 saw a particular 
surge in gun violence with 764 people killed. While progress has been made in recent 
years, including reaching fewer than 500 murders and 2,075 non-fatal shooting victims 
in 2019, unfortunately the city is on track in 2020 to exceed 2016's toll, with more than 
473 homicides and 1,957 non-fatal shooting incidents as of August 16th.
Figure 1. Annual Chicago homicide rate since early 2000s (Source: FBI Uniform Crime Reports (UCR))
Violence in Chicago often happens in outdoor public spaces, such as streets and alleys.
In 2019, 66 percent of homicides and 44 percent of shootings took place on the street or

New Programs (refer to assessment map)
Three community areas are recommended to have an outreach presence along the southeast 
corridor roughly between Pershing/39th (north) to 69th (south), and from State (west) to 
Cottage Grove (east): 1. Grand Boulevard (002); 2. Washington Park (002); and 3. Woodlawn 
(003). Outreach programming is needed to complement law enforcement efforts focusing on 
interruption of conflicts before they erupt into violence, preventing retaliations, and providing 
case management for highest risk/most acutely at-risk individuals. An outreach practice can be 
thoughtfully implemented to factor target areas (groups; beats), eligible local implementers, 
staffing recruitment, etc. An outreach practice can be established (fast track) in six to eight 
weeks dependent upon resources and identifying a viable local partner.

(U) New Illinois Coronavirus Cases Top 1,000 For The First Time; Pritzker Warns Increases Likely 
To Continue Into April 
New COVID-19 cases reported in Illinois topped 1,000 for the first time, state officials said Sunday, 
warning that the upward curve is likely to continue for weeks.  “It is fair to say that most of the models 
I’ve seen ... show that we’ll be peaking sometime in April,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said at his daily 
coronavirus news conference. “We’re not yet close to that.” The state has now recorded 4,596 positive 
COVID-19 tests and 65 deaths, 18 of which were announced Sunday. More than 90% of cases and 
deaths have come in the Chicago area, though that proportion is slowly shrinking as testing expands 
throughout the state.  Source:  Chicago Tribune 
 
(U) Trump Extends Social Distancing Guidelines To April 30, Predicts ‘Great Things' by June 1 
President Donald Trump announced Sunday that he's extending his administration's guidelines on social 
distancing during the COVID-19 outbreak until April 30.  Trump said last week that he wanted to see 
much of the country return to normal by Easter, April 12, despite warnings from top health experts that 
easing the guidelines too soon could cause widespread deaths and economic damage.  Trump said 
Friday that he would consult with his administration's top medical experts on whether to extend or 
change the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on slowing the spread of the 
coronavirus. But on Sunday, Trump said that the Easter target date was ""just an aspiration"" and that he 
expects ""great things to be happening"" by June 1. Instead, Trump said he believes Easter will mark ""the 
peak number, and it should start coming down, hopefully very substantially at that point.  Source:  NBC


I don’t believe in handing out manpower based on anecdotal information.  What I 
have always tried to do in my career is base those decisions on data.  

I have to dig in to how the Department uses data to make these decisions, but 
what I can tell you is that I am accustomed to using a formula to guide those 
decisions.  That formula should take into account crime trends, population 
density, critical infrastructure, and calls for service at a minimum.  

What I will be looking for in Chicago is to develop a model that accounts for those
factors and others.

I will also look to take the mystery out of how these decisions are made.  
Transparency is critical to building trust and I believe we should be transparent 
about the model we use to make staffing decisions so that elected leaders as 
well as the public will have a base level of understanding about how these 
decisions are made.


First of all, diversity is very important to me and I have already challenged my 
leadership team to do everything that we can to ensure that the demographics of the 
police department match the demographics of the City across all ranks.  

As you build diversity in the organization, you also establish better relationships with 
the community.  

Having said that, I also support former Interim Superintendent Beck’s action around 
merit promotion elimination.  What I think is misunderstood from this debate is that the 
consent decree provides us with a solution to increase diversity across all ranks in the 
Department.

As you know, the consent decree requires that there be an independent and complete 
evaluation of our promotional practices.  

It is my expectation that this evaluation would generate a series of recommendations 
that will address the lack of diversity in our upper ranks of the Department.  

One item I would expect to see is a formalized professional development program that 
deliberately seeks out diversity throughout the Department.  I am a big believer in 
formalized professional development programs across ranks and across demographic 
groups.  If we want the Department to reflect the demographics of the City, then we 
should have formalized development programs that reflect the Department we are 
trying to create. 

Another item I would expect to see is a formalized recruitment program.   This program 
needs to go beyond just a marketing campaign.  I think we should have a formalized 
recruiting team in the city that seeks to address diverse hiring for the Department.  I 
plan on working with the City to see how we might be able to do that in next fiscal 
year’s budget.  

In addition, I would like to see an expanded cadet program where we would recruit from
across the city and hopefully work with the public schools to attract candidates from the
very communities we serve.  

Finally, I would expect the evaluation to address best practices around the country.  I 
know there are departments out there that are doing a good job in attracting diversity 
within their ranks.  We need to learn from them and adapt what they have do to what 
will work here in Chicago.

6.5. Regulations Governing Reductions to or Waiver of MBE/WBE Goals

The following Regulations set forth the standards to be used in determining whether or not a reduction or
waiver of the MBE/WBE commitment goals of a particular contract is appropriate. If a bidder determines that
it is unable to meet the MBE and/or WBE Contract-Specific Goals on a City of Chicago contract, a written
request for the reduction or waiver of the commitment must be included in the bid or proposal.

The written request for reduction or waiver from the commitment must be in the form of a signed petition for
grant of relief from the MBE/WBE percentages submitted on the bidder's letterhead, and must demonstrate
that all required efforts as set forth in this document were taken to secure eligible Minority and Women
Business Enterprises to meet the commitments. The Chief Procurement Officer or designee shall determine
whether the request for the reduction or waiver will be granted.

1) Purpose

The City of Chicago (the “City”) adopts this [dentity Protection Policy pursuant to the
Identity Protection Act, 5 ILCS 179/1.et seq. The Identity Protection Act (the “Act’)
requires each local and State government agency in Illinois to draft, approve, and
implement an Identity Protection Policy to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of
Social Security numbers (“SSNs”) that agencies collect, maintain, and use.

The purpose of this Policy is to set forth the procedures and restrictions that must be
observed by all City employees regarding the use and availability of SSNs belonging to
City employees and the public. This Policy is effective immediately.

2) Access to Social Security Numbers .
a) Limited access: Only those City employees who are required to use or handle

information or documents that contain SSNs in the course of performing their
duties will have access to such information or documents.

b) Training: All City employees who have access to SSNs will receive training on
the proper handling of information that contains SSNs.

3) Displaying or Printing SSNs

The City shall not:

a) Publicly post or publicly display in any manner an individual's Social Security
number. “Publicly post’ or “publicly display” means to intentionally communicate
or otherwise intentionally make available to the general public.

Print an individual's Social Security number on any card required for an individual
to access products or services provided by the City.

Require an individual to transmit a Social Security number over the Internet,
unless the connection is secure or the Social Security number is encrypted,

Print an individual's Social Security number on any materials that are mailed to
the individual through the U.S. Postal Service, any private mail service, electronic

WHEREAS, The City of Chicago (“City”) is a home rule municipality as described in 
Section 6(a), Article VII of the 1970 Constitution of the State of Illinois, and as such may 
exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, The City established by ordinance at Chapter 2-84 of the Municipal Code of
Chicago a Department of Police (“CPD”) to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its 
residents; and
WHEREAS, Pursuant to 65 ILCS 5/3.1-30-5(a), the Mayor is authorized to appoint, with 
the advice and consent of the City Council, officers necessary to carry into effect the powers 
conferred upon municipalities, which, pursuant to Article VII, Section 6(a) of the Constitution of 
the State of Illinois, includes the power to regulate for the protection of the public health and 
safety; and
WHEREAS, The Police Accountability Task Force called for creation of a “Community 
Safety Oversight Board,” “comprised entirely of community residents,” with “power to oversee 
CPD, the new CPIA [now the Civilian Office of Police Accountability] and all police oversight 
mechanisms,” and specified that “The Community Board would ensure that ... all components of
the police oversight system are held fully accountable, operate with maximum transparency and
perform their roles in a manner that is informed by community needs”; and
WHEREAS, The United States Department of Justice concluded that “[i]t has never 
been more important to rebuild trust for the police within Chicago’s neighborhoods most 
challenged by violence, poverty, and unemployment,” and that “Chicago must undergo broad, 
fundamental reform to restore this trust,” which “will benefit both the public and CPD’s own 
officers,” and “is necessary to solve and prevent violent crime”; and
WHEREAS, Research indicates that public participation in the determination of police 
department policy helps to build trust in the police department; and
WHEREAS, People who trust the police department are more likely to cooperate with 
the police department, and public cooperation with the police department helps to reduce and 
solve crime; and
WHEREAS, This ordinance establishes a Community Commission for Public Safety and 
Accountability (“Commission”) for the purposes of increasing public safety; ensuring that CPD 
activities are directed toward maximizing public health and safety while minimizing any harm to 
residents; building trust and improving interactions between CPD and the people it serves; 
increasing public support for CPD policies and activities; improving interactions between CPD 
officers and the residents they serve; ensuring that CPD resources are not used inappropriately 
to address public health or safety issues that other professionals would be better equipped to 
address; increasing transparency and public input into CPD operation, policies, and 
performance; providing the residents of every Chicago community with meaningful opportunities
to shape CPD policies and practices that affect their lives; and increasing public accountability 
of CPD, the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, and the Police Board; and
WHEREAS, This ordinance also establishes District Councils for the purposes of 
building connections between CPD and the community; collaborating in the development and

property and causing harm to people. Events which are conducting both marches and caravan components have the 
potential threat for having the vehicles store and transport materials for such criminal actions. Officers should be 
aware of people and vehicles which stray away from the proposed route. 
 
In Montreal, a statue of Canada’s first prime minister was toppled during a “defund the police” rally on Saturday, 29 
August 2020. In Toronto, a statue of the Virgin Mary was decapitated by vandals at a Toronto catholic church on 
Sunday, 30 August 2020. In California, a statue of the Virgin Mary was decapitated at a California catholic church 
on 20 August 2020. Defacing and / or destroying statues have become a trending topic in open source social media. 
On 22 June 2020, a public post of interest was revealed via open source research stating, “We should definitely tear 
down statues of white Jesus.” (Source: https://twitter.com/soit_goes/status/1275111160963051522). This was posted 
publicly by the same subject that had made the following public post of interest on 18JUN20, “Fun socially 
distanced activities for this summer in Chicago: - tearing down the fascist Balbo monument; - unscrewing the “T” 
from the Trump Tower; - dumping paint all over the dead cop memorial; - an encampment at the Logan monument 
down the block from Lightfoot’s house.” (Source: https://twitter.com/soit_goes/status/1273697072777134082). This 
poster has been tentatively identified. On 19 June 2020 at approximately 2200 hours, another identified subject who 
had originally organized and then canceled an event campaigning “F*@k That Colonizer” posted a live video of 
himself at the Columbus statue.   
 
Open source research revealed that a national solidarity event was scheduled on Saturday, 05 September 2020 
campaigning “Nationwide Protest – Trump Pence Out Now!” This campaign launched “60 Days of Struggle” 
leading up to the November Election. More nationwide solidarity actions are anticipated. 
 
In light of the death of U.S. Army Spc. Vanessa Guillen, protests are starting to trend at Armed Services Recruiting 
Centers. District personnel should be aware of any locations within their districts to curb any potential “pop-up” 
style actions or criminal damage or defacement. 
 
CPIC is continuing to stream for information regarding potential activity that has no definitive date or times of 
occurrence, or undisclosed motives. 
 
 
 
This event may be in violation of Illinois Governor Pritzker's EXECUTIVE ORDER IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 (COVID-19 
EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 41, Section 2.d) Limit gatherings. Any gathering of more than fifty people is prohibited unless exempted 
by this Executive Order. Nothing in this Executive Order prohibits the gathering of members of a household or residence. Because 
in-person contact presents the greatest risk of transmission of COVID-19, Illinoisans are encouraged to continue limiting inperson 
contact with others and to expand their social contact cautiously. Gathering remotely continues to be the safest way to interact with 
those outside a household or residence. 
 
It should be noted that some of this information describes First Amendment protected activities. The CPIC recognizes that 
Americans have constitutionally protected rights to assemble, speak, and petition the government. The CPIC safeguards these 
rights and only reports on First Amendment protected activities for operational planning in the interest of assuring the safety and 
security of the public including demonstrators and public safety personnel. The CPIC will continue to communicate these events with 
other law enforcement partners in an effort to facilitate the Chicago Police Department's mission of protecting the lives, property and 
rights of all people, to maintain order, and enforce the law impartially.
